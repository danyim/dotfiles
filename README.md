# dotfiles

@danyim's dotfiles, circa 2017.

I usually stick to Inconsolata as my main programming font and use the Zenburn theme where I can in editors and iTerm2/Hyper.

## Installation
- Install the following manually...
    - Homebrew
    - Sublime Text 3 (with Package Control)

## Updating dotfiles
- `chmod 777 read-system.sh` and `./read-system.sh`
