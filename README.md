# dotfiles

My dotfiles, circa 2017.

I usually stick to Inconsolata as my main programming font and use the Zenburn theme where I can in editors and iTerm2/Hyper.

## Installation
- Install the following manually...
    - Homebrew
    - Sublime Text 3 (with Package Control)

## Updating dotfiles
- Run `./read.sh`

## Loading dotfiles into system
- Run `./load.sh`
    - This will backup any existing dotfiles into a new directory `~/.dotfiles.backup/<UTC epoch>`
