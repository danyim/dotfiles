# .localrc.example
# 
# Copy this file to ~/.localrc and customize it with your local machine-specific
# settings. The .localrc file is sourced at the end of .zshrc and should NOT be
# committed to version control (add it to .gitignore).
#
# This is useful for:
# - Machine-specific environment variables
# - Work-specific configurations
# - Private API keys and tokens
# - Local PATH modifications
# - Anything you don't want in your public dotfiles
